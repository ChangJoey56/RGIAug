- Code repo for our paper entitled "Generalizable Polyp Segmentation via Randomized Global Illumination Augmentation" accepted by IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (J-BHI). Our work introduces a novel approach to address the domain shift issues in automatic polyp segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks.  
- Code is coming soon.
