# Generalizable Polyp Segmentation via Randomized Global Illumination Augmentation
This repository hosts the official implementation of our research titled 'Generalizable Polyp Segmentation via Randomized Global Illumination Augmentation,' which is currently under review at the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (J-BHI). Our work introduces a novel approach to address the domain shift issues in automatic polyp segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks.  
The full code, detailed documentation, and examples will be made available upon the paper's acceptance. We believe this repository will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of medical image analysis, providing tools and insights to advance the early detection of colorectal cancer through improved polyp segmentation.
